<p>Good day!</p>
<p>My name is Denis and I am a beginner Python developer who is currently looking for work.</p>
<p>This website is my pet-project.</p>
<p>I have completed several courses in Python, Django, and databases. I have also written another several
    pet projects, which can be found on my Github (link will be below). I love to learn and I am
    confident that I can make up for any missing knowledge and learn the necessary technologies.</p>
<p>I am currently looking for work because I feel that I have the strength and confidence to not only
    complete tasks "by the book", but also bring value to the business. Additionally, I am motivated by
    the fact that commercial experience will allow me to grow much faster.</p>
<p>I would be very happy to have the opportunity to contribute to the success of good team and learn
    from experienced specialists.</p>
