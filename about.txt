Project in progress.

Simple test task in the past.
I liked the idea, that's why I added a lot of functions inside.

Stack:
Django 4, MySQL, Redis, Celery, Docker.

Something like bit.ly.
User can write own subpart (short part) to make his URL shorter.
This service not for personal account, that's why it use sessions for users.
Home page is a form which make short links, also if user was before and made some links - it will be on the home page below.

If user didn't active some time, all his links will be delete by Celery.

Also I used captcha as a defence from bots.

(For the future) The feedback page is a page, where somebody can write to me and it will come for my e-mail.

Page about me just about me, not more:)

I had axperiments with data caching, but right now I don't use it because I always add a new functions.
At the end I would like to add cache and use docker for deploying my application for some host.

Funny that I works on it a lot of time, but description takes a few strings.
