Simple test task in the past.
I liked the idea, that's why I added a lot of functions inside.

Stack:
Django 4, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Flower, Docker, Django Debug Toolbar, Captcha.

Something like bit.ly.
User can write own subpart (short part) to make his URL shorter.
This service not for personal account, that's why it use sessions for users.
Home page is a form which make short links, also if user was before and made some links - it will be on the home page below.

If user didn't active some time, all his links will be delete by Celery.

Also I used captcha as a defence from bots.

The feedback page is a page, where somebody can write to me and it will come for my e-mail.

Page about me just about me, not more:)

I had axperiments with data caching, but right now I don't use it because I always add a new functions.
